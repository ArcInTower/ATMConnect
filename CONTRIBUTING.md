# Contributing to ATMConnect

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ATMConnect! This project is an experimental banking application with Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity, developed as an AI-assisted coding experiment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle 8.0+
- Git
- IDE with Spring Boot support (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/ArcInTower/ATMConnect.git`
3. Navigate to project: `cd ATMConnect`
4. Build the project: `./gradlew build`
5. Run tests: `./gradlew test`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ATMConnect follows **Hexagonal Architecture** principles:
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External integrations (BLE, database, security)
- **Presentation Layer**: REST APIs and controllers

### BLE Architecture
- **ATM = BLE Peripheral** (advertises services, accepts connections)
- **Mobile = BLE Central** (scans for ATMs, initiates connections)

## üìã How to Contribute

### 1. Code Contributions
- **Bug Fixes**: Always welcome
- **New Features**: Please open an issue first to discuss
- **Security Improvements**: Highly appreciated
- **Documentation**: Help improve clarity and completeness

### 2. Testing Contributions

- Integration tests for BLE components
- Security test cases
- Performance benchmarks

### 3. Documentation Contributions
- Code documentation and JavaDoc
- Architecture documentation
- Setup and deployment guides
- API documentation

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Write self-documenting code
- Add JavaDoc for public APIs
- Maximum 120 characters per line

### Security Guidelines
- **Never commit secrets** or API keys
- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement proper input validation
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Follow OWASP guidelines

### BLE Development
- Follow documented BLE architecture
- Use proper GATT service UUIDs
- Implement security requirements (encryption, authentication)
- Test with realistic BLE scenarios
- Consider power consumption and range

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make small, focused commits
3. Write descriptive commit messages
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Create Pull Request

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

- Change 1
- Change 2

Closes #issue-number
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Required Tests
- Unit tests for all new business logic
- Integration tests for BLE functionality
- Security tests for authentication/encryption
- Architecture tests for layer boundaries

### Test Quality
- Tests should be fast and reliable
- Use meaningful test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
./gradlew test

# Specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "BLEArchitectureTest"

# Integration tests only
./gradlew integrationTest

# Security tests only
./gradlew test --tests "*Security*"
```

## üìö Documentation Standards

- JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
- Inline comments for complex business logic
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for major decisions
- README updates for new features

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Request/response examples
- Error code documentation
- Security requirements
